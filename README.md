### Description
This is a final project for DGMD E-14 through Harvard Extension School. We are creating a virtual reality application/experience using the Unity game engine. The application will consist of a procedural operating room where the user is tasked with picking up objects which have fallen onto the floor and bringing them to the trashbin. 

### How to Install and Setup
This project was created in Unity using the Occulus SDK for VR integration.

	- This project is created for the following Unity version: 2021.3.13f1
	- You will need an IDE such as Visual Studio Community and other usual Unity dependencies: https://unity.com/download
- Occulus:
	- This project was created for integration with the Meta Quest 2 wearable, however, it will also run locally without this hardware.
	- Depending on your wearable hardware, you will need a companion app for development: https://developer.oculus.com/
