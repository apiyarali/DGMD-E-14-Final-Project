### Description
This is a final project for DGMD E-14 through Harvard Extension School. We are creating a virtual reality application/experience using the Unity game engine. The application will consist of a procedural operating room where the user is tasked with picking up objects and bringing them to the surgical tray. 

### To-Do
- [ ] Procedural Operating Room (Entity)
  - [ ] Basic Room
    - [ ] Create Play Scene
    - [ ] Create GameObject 
    - [ ] Generate Floor from room data (2D array)
    - [ ] Generate Walls, Ceilings & Lights

- [ ] Pick-Up Objects
  - [ ] Pick-Up GameObject
    - [ ] Create a game object with a sphere collision box whose radius is equal to the player's pick-up range.
    - [ ] Add a check to the PlayerController script for OnCollisionEnter to see if the object can be picked up.
    - [ ] Display an icon on any object within range of the player than can be picked up.
    - [ ] Allow a button press to shoot a ray which then triggers the pick-up object state as "picked up".
    - [ ] Have the picked up object change its position to be in front of the player and move with them.
