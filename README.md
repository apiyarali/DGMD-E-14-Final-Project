### Description
This is a final project for DGMD E-14 through Harvard Extension School. We are creating a virtual reality application/experience using the Unity game engine. The application will consist of a procedural operating room where the user is tasked with picking up objects which have fallen onto the floor and bringing them to the trashbin. 

### How to Install and Setup
This project was created in Unity using the Oculus SDK for VR integration.
- Unity:
	- This project is created for the following Unity version: 2021.3.13f1
	- You will need an IDE such as Visual Studio Community and other usual Unity dependencies: https://unity.com/download
- Oculus:
	- This project was created for integration with the Meta Quest 2 wearable, however, it will also run locally without this hardware.
	- Depending on your wearable hardware, you will need a companion app for development: https://developer.oculus.com/
	- You will need to setup Quest Link (or something comparable for your hardware): https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/connect-link-with-quest-2/

### How to Run
- Close Unity, then start the Oculus app on your computer  to ensure the link between Unity and the hardware occurs.
- Open Unity and load the project ensuring you select the version noted above.
- Reconnect your VR headset to your development computer via USB after opening the Oculus app and Unity.
- Your headset will prompt you for permissions (to update files and enable Oculus Link, for example) and you must ensure you provide these for the app to deploy via USB.
- Load the scene "ORScene" and press the play button within the editor to use mouse and keyboard controls.
